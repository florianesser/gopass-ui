## What is Gopass and Gopass UI?

> [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of making it cross-platform and adding additional features – (Taken from Github)

The repository you're currently looking at contains `Gopass UI`, an Electron based UI wrapper for your `gopass` on the command line. It makes your life easier by providing a rich graphical user interface to search and manage your secrets. It looks like this:

In addition there is a globally usable search window that can be opened with `(cmd || ctrl) + shift + p`.

## How can I use it?

Just [download the latest packaged application](https://github.com/codecentric/gopass-ui/releases/latest) from our releases and install it.

Currently we support binaries for MacOS, Windows and Linux (Deb, Rpm).
Of course, you need to have [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) up and running already. We also recommend you to use a dialog-based PIN-entry-tool for typing in your GPG passphrase like [pinentry-mac for MacOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pinentry-mac) instead of using the default terminal-based.
